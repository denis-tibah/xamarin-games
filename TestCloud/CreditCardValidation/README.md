CreditCardValidation
====================

This directory contains the CreditCardValidation project for Xamarin Test Cloud. There are three directories:

* `Start` - This folder holds the CreditCardValidation project, without any tests. It is the starting point for the `UITest` and `Calabash` projects.
* `UITest` -  This folder holds the sample project with tests written in C# using Xamarin.UITest. It is the companion code for the [Xamarin.UITest Walkthrough](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/walkthrough/) guide.
* `Calabash` - This folder holds the sample project with tests written in Ruby using Calabash. [Calabash test documents](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/intro-to-uitest/)
