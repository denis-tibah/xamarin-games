CreditCardValidation-Calabash
=============================

This sample is the companion code for the [Introduction to Calabash](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/introduction-to-calabash/) guide.

Create a test run at [Xamarin Test Cloud](http://testcloud.xamarin.com) and make note of your API key. Then create a copy of the file `testcloud-submit-example.sh`, (i.e. `testcloud-submit.sh`). Update your copy of the file with your Test Cloud API key. You may optionally update the device ID's as well.

Once you have done that, you may run `./testcloud-submit.sh` and it will compile the iOS application and submit it to Test Cloud for you.
