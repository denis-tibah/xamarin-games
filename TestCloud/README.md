Xamarin Test Cloud Samples
==========================

This directory contains a collection of samples for Xamarin Test Cloud. The samples are sort by the project in question, and then by Calabash or Xamarin.UITest.  

For example, the directory `mobile-samples/TestCloud/CreditCardValidation` contains three folders:

* `Start` - this is the CreditCalidValidation application without any Test Cloud Tests written
* `Calabash` - this directory holds the `CreditCardValidation` application with tests written using Calabash.
* `UITest` - this directory holds the `CreditCardValidation` application with tests written using Xamarin.UITest


See [Xamarin's Developer Centre](http://developer.xamarin.com) for more information about how to use [Xamarin Test Cloud](http://developer.xamarin.com/testcloud/).
