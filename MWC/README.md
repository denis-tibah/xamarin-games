MWC 2012
===========

MWC 2012 is an open-source conference schedule application for www.mobileworldcongress.com in Barcelona, Spain (February 2012).

It illustrates proper application architecture layering and uses a common code base for the Business Layer (BL), Data Access Layer (DAL), and Data Layer (DL) layers. It then separates out the User Interface (UI) and Application Layer (AL) into the appropriate device-applications.
