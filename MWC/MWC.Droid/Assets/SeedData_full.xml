    <t>Augmented Reality</t>
    <o>
      The Augmented Reality (AR) Forum at Mobile World Congress is where mobile AR will expand from a research prototype to a real world solution. Mobile AR brings together people on the move, the digital content on the Internet and the physical world. It leverages the high performance of our newest devices, speed of the latest network technologies and the need of people to tap into information while on the go.

      The AR Forum is a one-day, industry-led forum that will allow sponsors the opportunity to share practical experiences through case studies, offer insights on how different geographies are adopting AR, suggest where to get the latest tools and services, and make sure they are the first to be found when brands, enterprises and developers are looking for information on mobile AR.

    <t>Augmented Reality Forum – Sponsored by Khronos Group</t>
    <o>
      Augmented Reality “AR” synchronizes digital data with the physical world in real time to enhance a user’s experience of their environment, and pushes the boundaries of vision and graphics processing, together with user interface, device and display design.
      Although AR’s ‘killer app’ hasn’t yet emerged, powerful technologies for merging sensor and vision processing with graphical augmentations will soon enable new generations of mobile applications to deliver unprecedented utility and immersiveness in many application domains.
      For silicon and system vendors, AR presents significant challenges and opportunities for differentiation. Not only do AR-capable mobile devices require real-time sensor, vision and graphics processing; this diverse processing must seamlessly interoperate at unprecedented levels of performance, otherwise AR applications will fail to engage users and will place heavy burdens on network operators’ infrastructure.
      At the AR Forum, the Khronos Group describes its open, cross-platform API standards that provide essential acceleration for graphics, vision and sensor processing, and interoperate to enable compelling AR-enabled user experiences, creating new opportunities in the mobile ecosystem.
      The AR Forum also features Khronos Member demonstrations highlighting AR-ready platforms based on Khronos APIs, and ends in a panel discussion.

    <t>Opening Keynote 1: Mobile Operator Strategies</t>
    <o>
      While the mobile industry remains robust despite a turbulent global economic climate, the world’s mobile operators face many critical issues which will define the future growth of the industry.  Perhaps one of the most pressing is how to balance the need for continued investment in growth opportunities and the challenges presented by a competitive marketplace, limited spectrum resources and highly discerning customers.
      The plethora of mobile connected devices and new services in the market today provide a tantalising glimpse into the future of mobile, but much still needs to be done in order to deliver on the promise. This session will explore a range of issues such as: How can operators continue to evolve their business models as disruptive services challenge the status quo of traditional revenue streams? What opportunities does the entry of mobile technology into new verticals provide operators with? How can operators remain at the forefront of the technology innovation that has made our industry one of the key growth drivers of the global economy?
      Join the CEOs of the world’s leading operators as they discuss the strategies that are shaping the mobile industry today and well into the future.

    <t>Mobile Applications: Apps for All - How Apps are Changing our Lives </t>
    <o>
      Apps are integral to the way many of us now live, work and play. From the games business to gamifying business, apps exist for everything from throwaway fun through to essential work tools. Some apps we pay for, some we don’t. Some we probably don’t even think of as apps, since they fit so seamlessly into the way we live our lives.
      Overall, the apps business is booming; Gartner forecasts US$15.9 billion end-user spend on apps in 2012. But reports also suggest that half of apps make less than US$3k each. Given the months of work that can go into producing an app, this kind of return on investment can’t be sustainable long term. How should the apps ecosystem evolve to support development?
      This session will look at two sides of the app equation: first, the money question – what is the most sustainable way to build an apps business model? And second, a discussion of how the world works for developers and a look at the type of apps that are out there changing the way we live.

    <t>Mobile Health: Getting Mobile into the System - What We’ve Learnt so Far</t>
    <o>
      Most of the successes in mobile health to date have been built from the bottom up: small but impactful projects that help communities with anything from increasing access to health information to improving maternal care. But the real step change for mobile health will come from national and international scale, which means, in many cases, getting mobile into existing government and private health systems.
      There are still many and varied systemic barriers to scaling mobile health, but progress is being made. The US Food and Drug Administration recently began to approve mobile health applications and is expected to issue guidance on mHealth devices in 2012. It is just this sort of progress that is vital to building confidence to invest in mHealth.
      This session will look at what has been done to date to get mobile health integrated into and supported by large health systems. Players from across the ecosystem will offer case studies from their own experience and will discuss what still needs to be done to get the most from mHealth.

    <t>Mobile Cloud: Competitive Landscape</t>
    <o>
      Gone are the years when a competitor was a competitor and a partner was a partner. In today’s fluid competitive scenario, mobile operators must compete and collaborate amongst themselves and with other industry stakeholders. Software and Internet players are partners in the morning and competitors in the evening as the lines of competition blur.

      This session will address the challenges that this hyper-dynamic competitive scenario bring to mobile operators as well as the entire ecosystem. Business relationships are going beyond joint-ventures, M&amp;A and strategic partnerships and in this scenario risks and opportunities are greater than ever.

      Compared to Over the Top competition, traditional communications service providers have at times been slow to act and react to changing market conditions. However, there are striking demonstrations of business agility within the communications world as service providers are adapting their legacy infrastructures to tackle new requirements. These successes have been based on becoming a flexible enterprise through identifying and interpreting relevant data to make quick business decisions. To continue to overcome diminishing profit margins, service providers must become more responsive to their business environment and their consumers.

    <t>Mobile Applications: The Future of Voice &amp; Messaging</t>
    <o>
      Voice and messaging, those most fundamental of all mobile services, are changing. Mobile network operators used to be the undisputed rulers of voice and messaging on the go. Occasionally there was a challenge to their primacy – VoIP made a few headlines and mobile IM was a US frontrunner for a while – but global mobile voice and SMS usage was robust.
      However, the popularity of smartphones, wifi offload and unlimited data plans has helped make it cheap and easy for consumers to get their voice and messaging from someone else, and operators have begun to report the impact.
      But this isn’t just about a battle between mobile operators and over-the-top players. It’s a story of partnerships and changing consumer behaviours, of richer communications and new business models. This session will bring together key players in this evolving marketplace to ask whether there has been a shift in the balance of power, and what mobile voice and messaging will look like in years to come.

    <t>Mobile Health: mHealth &amp; The User - Building Trust, Creating Demand</t>
    <o>
      For mobile health to be a success, its proponents must find ways to optimise mobile for users of existing health services: health practitioners, patients and consumers.  It should, put simply, meet their needs.  These needs will not only be direct health improvements but will also encompass complex and interrelated questions of operational efficiency, accountability, and life and working style.  End users must also trust that mobile health will deliver what it promises.

      This session will question the extent to which health practitioners, patients and consumers in different markets are ready and willing to use mobile health. It will discuss the way patients and consumers perceive different uses of mobile in health, from wellness apps and social networks through to enterprise apps and remote-monitoring devices. Speakers will also discuss how to market the mobile health message, and will examine approaches to branding and promotion of mHealth services from different levels of the value chain.

    <t>Mobile Cloud: Contending for Content </t>
    <o>
      The huge number of cloud solutions available today is only set to grow in the future as the adoption of smartphones, tablets and other media devices increase rapidly. The increase in mobile data capacity requirements due to the cloud presents some challenges for mobile network operators and other service providers in optimising content delivery. How can mobile network operators and other service providers ensure the most efficient use of their networks and other assets to successfully deliver cloud-based content and monetise cloud solutions profitably?
      This session will discuss mobile cloud content delivery models and will assess how mobile network operators and other service providers can best leverage their assets to maximise their opportunities in the value chain and monetise mobile cloud solutions successfully.

    <t>Business Transformation: Operators as Intelligent Partners</t>
    <o>
      Jointly developed with


      With the spread of the mobile Internet, smartphones and the emergence of M2M, the role of service providers within an increasingly complex value chain has evolved and as new devices emerge, more change is on the horizon. This evolution exposes service providers to the needs of new industries; those service providers that can work with and support these needs will thrive while the slowest will fall by the wayside.
      Service providers’ networks, billing relationships, data handling and wealth of information offer magnificent opportunities for would-be partners to take advantage of. However, the challenge for service providers lies in presenting these in useful formats to support creative and lucrative partnerships. The success of OTT players is testament to past shortcomings in this area. How can service providers rise to the technical and business challenges of becoming intelligent partners to diverse industries?
      This session examines the hurdles to overcome and outstanding examples to follow.

    <t>Keynote 3: Mobile Operator Strategies in Developing Markets</t>
    <o>
      The positive impact of mobility on developing economies is well documented, and as the number of global mobile connections continues to grow, many of the additional connections will come from the developing world. But bridging the digital divide is about more than merely providing access to mobile phones.
      How have operators tailored their business models to thrive in a world where economic constraints are most harsh? How have the services they have provided helped to enrich the lives of consumers and communities? What impact will mobile have on users who are accessing the internet for the first time? How can this spur a new wave of innovative services and help the developing world to continue its upward trend of economic inclusion?
      The CEOs of many of the world’s leading operators will share their insights and pioneering work in this developing world in a keynote which will challenge conventional wisdom and paradigms from the developed world.

    <t>Keynote 4: Exploring the Mobile Cloud </t>
    <o>
      As individuals and enterprises become increasingly mobile, the demand for online storage, delivery and access of content and availability of services is exploding. This is a mobile cloud world, a world where one’s entire life must be accessible remotely and instantly from any device of choice. In this scenario, players across the industry, including regulators, must collaborate to address the challenges of technological reliability, online privacy, user safety as well as cultural barriers. In the end, users’ demand to have personal clouds, be it for entertainment or work, will pose a number of challenges for all participants in the ecosystem, including governments.
      How will the mobile industry deliver a seamless service experience while dealing with this new paradigm where all our content is stored online? Where are we in terms of readiness and ability to offer reliable and affordable cloud services? And which are the biggest hurdles to overcome as these services become widely adopted worldwide?
      CEOs from across the value chain will discuss the future of the mobile cloud, its requirements and drivers, and innovations we can expect to see in the coming years.

      Speaker: Mr. Keiichi Jay Miyahara, NEC’s Corporate Chief Engineer
      The life with "internet" has evolved from simple email, file transfer, and web surfing to  web-based communities and hosted services, such as social-networking sites, video sharing sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies. It can be said that most of these services are "user centric" and "user driven". They are gradually changing the way we communicate and are changing the business model of communication and service providers. LTE started by solving clear technical objectives: improve radio spectrum efficiency and provide economical Mobile Broadband Wireless network. The introduction of an all IP network architecture and various Open Interfaces will allow more flexibility in developing and deploying new services. This session will outline analysis of how this evolution will enable new services to be created and how it may create new business models similar to what has been happening in the Cloud era.

    <t>Mobile Applications: Building for Tomorrow - The Evolution of App Development</t>
    <o>
      The changes in the app-development environment have been many and varied over the last few years. The journey from 2007, when the market that didn’t even know what apps were, let alone really use them, to where we are today has already seen the rise and fall of several development platforms. This fluctuating landscape has forced developers to make difficult choices about what to develop for which platform. Plus it’s getting harder and harder for individual apps to stand out as they become victims of their own success.

      This session will look at the current app development landscape and will examine the emerging trends that will shape the future ecosystem. Speakers will discuss the drivers for change, the value of HTML5 versus developing for native platforms and the problem of discovery. They will also look beyond handset-based apps to mobile apps for TV, for cars etc, and will consider what the ecosystem and business models for non-handset and cross-platform apps look like.

    <t>Mobile Health: Emerging Markets - Partnerships for Growth</t>
    <o>
      The emerging economies present a challenge for mHealth equal to, but different from, the more mature health markets. Many regions lack robust health infrastructures and even basic health care provision, which presents considerable difficulties in improving locals’ health. But the lack of legacy health systems and universal healthcare support may mean that the benefits of mobile health can be felt in the emerging economies much sooner than in the developed nations.
      There is no one-size-fits-all model for bringing these benefits to people on the ground but it is generally agreed that partnerships will be a fundamental feature. The varied capabilities – commercial, technical, regulatory, cultural - needed to deliver fully realised mHealth services means that no single player can do it on their own.
      This session will consider how partnerships will work in the emerging markets to deliver successful mHealth services. It will discuss the efficacy of existing mHealth projects and consider how to build sustainable mHealth business models for low and middle income countries.

    <t>Mobile Cloud: The Home of the Future Embraces Mobile Cloud</t>
    <o>
      Mobile cloud services, ranging from email, messaging and storage solutions to gaming applications are increasing rapidly. What’s more, the user experience in the home is extending; cloud services are being accessed by multiple media devices using both mobile and fixed line connections. While this choice is potentially empowering for the user, it can create a fragmented user experience as the delivery of content may not always extend to all the user’s devices. How can the user pay for cloud content once, but access the same content seamlessly on multiple devices in the home, regardless of whether using a mobile or fixed line connection?
      This session will explore what mobile network operators and other service providers can do to ensure that the user remains at the centre of the cloud experience as cloud content and media devices continue to proliferate.

    <t>Mobile Advertising: Mobile in the Marketing Mix - Does Having an App Count?</t>
    <o>
      Mobile has the potential to be all things to all men when it comes to advertising. Big screens and fast networks mean mobile can compete for eyeballs with TV and movies; search puts it up against the fixed internet; SMS and messaging are possible replacements for direct mail. But is such a blanket approach the right one? What is the ‘right’ use of mobile in advertising? Does the contextual nature of mobile actually mean that we should be talking about marketing, not advertising?
      This session will ask how mobile should fit into a brand’s cross-platform marketing strategy. It will consider how we should conceptualise mobile, whether in terms of its potential to create a short term splash or to build and support long-term consumer engagement.

      Network Optimisation and Data Monetisation
      With Strategy Analytics, Openwave Systems, Juniper Networks, and guest mobile operators

      The next wave of mobile video and collaboration apps are blurring the line between subscriber and publisher. User-generated content has increased 14 times since 2010, a trend that necessitates new ways of thinking about network performance and personalisation.
      LTE networks provide the foundation for a more “symmetrical internet” (supporting near-equal upload and download traffic), but an operator’s profitability ultimately depends on how well they can deliver a compelling user experience whilst optimising their traffic management and network architectures to monetise rapidly growing volumes of rich content.
      Join us as we examine holistic approaches to network optimisation – approaches that complement bandwidth maximization techniques with best practices for managing subscriber demand and policy. Based on engagements with customers worldwide, we will discuss how the following areas are key in ensuring success in the new mobile internet:

    <t>Mobilising the Retail Business </t>
    <o>
      It’s not news that mobile technologies are making a huge impact on the retail business. Instant price comparison, mobile payment technologies, competitive online alternatives and the convenience appeal that mobility brings to the casual window-shopper have surely changed the way we all shop and this industry works.
      By leveraging on better knowledge of consumer behaviour, demographics and context, retailers are developing more attractive ways to improve the overall shopping experience, all the way from inventory management - one of the most important secrets of the trade - to mobile payments and transactions and it seems that the smartphone revolution has just started to redefine the retail business.
      This session will bring together executives from different players in the mobile retail ecosystem to discuss the latest trends and drivers that are shaping this revolution.

    <t>Mobile Enterprise: Maximising Workforce Productivity in the Age of Consumerisation</t>
    <o>
      The enterprise is becoming increasingly mobile - and personal. The lines between work and personal lives are blurring; the use of personal mobile devices in the workplace is adding to the complexity for enterprise IT departments which must manage this proliferation of personal mobile devices and ensure device security. In light of this growing consumerisation of IT, how can enterprises most effectively mobilise securely? Are bolt-on mobile enterprise solutions sufficient, or is it necessary to integrate mobile solutions deep within the enterprise’s infrastructure fabric? What is clear is that enterprise mobility needs to offer a compelling user experience.
      This session will showcase examples of solutions that are successfully mobilising the enterprise. It will also discuss the challenges faced by mobile network operators and other service providers in rolling-out mobile enterprise solutions in the age of IT consumerisation and will ask how enterprises can most effectively utilise mobile technologies to maximise workforce productivity.

    <t>Mobile Cloud: Cloud &amp; Network Intelligence</t>
    <o>
      In recent years operators have struggled against the threat of disintermediation from disruptive Over The Top players and the prospect of being relegated simply to ‘pipe’ status, dumb or not. Today, technology trends offer operators the chance to gain renewed relevance for their customers.
      The increasing convergence between networks, IT and cloud capabilities offers operators many new ways of understanding their customers, networks and services. This in turn opens up a wealth of opportunities to deliver smarter services, engage in timely ways with customers and identify cost savings.
      The visibility and control enabled by combining cloud methodologies with extra intelligence in the network will be vital to reclaiming a share of customers’ attention and wallets. This session examines practical experiences at the cutting edge of such activities and looks at where such capabilities will lead.

    <t>Mobile Advertising: Context is King - Advertising &amp; Marketing with Mobile Social Media </t>
    <o>
      It’s no surprise that, given mobile’s inherently personal nature, it has grown quickly to be a major channel for social media. This willingness of users to engage with mobile social networking offers real opportunities for brands to create contextually relevant messages for their customers.
      Advertisers are already getting get a grip on PC-based social media: eMarketer predicts social network advertising revenues to reach US$10 billion in 2013, almost double the $5.5 billion forecast for 2011. But the personal gets more personal and the contextual more contextual with mobile, so marketers still have a lot to contend with before marketing via mobile social networks really lives up to its potential.
      This session will ask how the combination of presence and social context that mobile offers can be used for brand advertising. It will ask whether audience targeting and relevance is more assured via the mobile channel, and how the mobile social media approach can fit with a wider advertising campaign.

    <t>Keynote 5: Mobile OS &amp; Applications</t>
    <o>
      Applications continue to transform the mobile experience, offering new and innovative ways of delivering services and experiences to an ever wider audience.
      In a shake-up of the traditional mobile value chain, new ecosystems are being built around software platforms and operating systems, constantly redrawing the line between partners and competitors in a dynamic environment. This new paradigm continues to pose a real threat of disintermediation for operators, and as the mobile industry becomes ever more reliant on Internet-based communications, the importance of software in the value chain is only set to grow.

      What steps are traditional mobile players taking to ensure they remain a relevant voice for their end users and which partnerships will prove most conducive to that end? How do new challengers see this competitive landscape and the role they are set to play? How will the roll out of new web standards such as HTML 5 and IPv6 impact the ecosystem? In this session, CEOs from across the mobile ecosystem will take the stage to share their thoughts on these industry-changing issues.

      Enabling Next Generation Mobile Messaging: Protecting the Networks and the Subscribers

      The next generation of messaging leverages tightly integrated Internet, Social and Mobile communications, changing the way we all interact.  These changes, along with the insatiable appetite of consumers wanting more - more data, more convenience, more capabilities - not only bring new revenue channels but also new security threats. With over 5 billion active mobile connections globally, the risk of messaging threats are high. Operators must acknowledge this risk if they want to offer innovative services without putting their subscribers at risk of messaging abuse and fraud.

      In this session Cloudmark will reveal what this rapid evolution means to mobile network security and what operators can do to protect their network and their subscribers. Included in the session will be the latest global data on rapidly evolving threats as well as a current case study on a global mobile operator and how they are addressing current threats and enabling next generation mobile services.

    <t>Keynote 6: Financial Services in a Mobile World</t>
    <o>
      Despite the incredible success enjoyed by the first wave of mobile money services, more advanced financial services have been slow in coming to mobile in emerging markets. At the same time, technology innovation and mobile applications such as NFC have played an important role in driving demand in developed economies, but have yet to reach worldwide adoption.

      All this is set to change as operators, financial institutions and regulators make giant strides towards building the necessary regulatory and business frameworks to support mobile money services on a truly global scale. In addition, the proliferation of NFC-enabled handsets, and the deployment of the associated infrastructure is also reaching the tipping point which will bring advanced mobile money services to the mass market. 2012 promises to be a pivotal year for the mobile and financial industries as they seek to offer the best of both worlds in an integrated, profitable and secure way.

      Which financial services will prove most successful on a global scale, and which will be confined to local geographies? How important a role will regulation continue to play? With trust and accountability being critical factors in the financial services space, what assurances and protections are operators and their partners able to provide consumers?

      To discuss these questions and more, CEOs from financial institutions and mobile operators will take to the stage in a keynote dedicated to addressing the complex issues surrounding mobile money.

    <t>Mobile Security Forum Session Sponsored by Trend Micro</t>
    <o>
      In this session, we begin with an opening presentation by Trend Micro’s Senior Director of Consumerization, Cesare Garlati, who explores the key questions surrounding mobile technology in the enterprise. “Consumer Mobile Technology in the Enterprise: A Leap of Faith?” - An increasing number of companies are opening corporate networks and data to consumer mobile devices, as employees demand to bring their own smartphones and tablets to work.  However, consumer mobile technology is generally not as secure and manageable as required by the enterprise. And too many companies make the mistake of trying to stop the influx of consumer IT. What new mobile platforms will your organization contend with? What built-in security models do they provide? What vulnerabilities are they exposed to? How rigorous is the scrutiny of the official application markets? Is the corporate data stored in these devices safe? Next, Trend Micro’s Rik Ferguson will then highlight key emerging mobile threats to watch out for. Finally Cesare and Rik will be joined by Chris Silver from the Altimeter Group &amp; Nigel Stanley from Bloor Research as they answer your questions around this complex issue.

    <t>Regional Focus: BRICS &amp; The Challenges of Innovation</t>
    <o>
      Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, a group of big emerging markets regularly grouped together under the acronym “BRICS”, are amongst the top five global mobile markets with nearly 45% of the world’s subscribers in total. Obviously, the biggest contributors for such massive numbers are China and India with nearly one billion subscribers each, but proportionalities aside, these five markets have been, at least for the last few years, the biggest growth drivers in their respective regions for global vendors and mobile operating groups.

      However, it is not easy for mobile operators to thrive in these markets. Complicated and heavy taxation coupled with slow regulation hinders innovation. Low average national income is a natural barrier to increasing ARPU and to offering value added services. High growth in prepaid markets still keeps operators too busy to invest in services designed to adjacent verticals such as financial services, automotive and healthcare.

      This session will examine how key industry players in such diverse countries are managing to drive growth, cope with a demanding and ever-expanding subscriber base and promote the next wave of innovation.

    <t>Networks: Infrastructure Costs in the Age of Austerity</t>
    <o>
      Many developed telecoms markets are struggling against static or declining ARPUs, while operators in emerging markets typically serve low-ARPU customers from the start. Cutting the cost of deploying and managing infrastructure is a valuable profit enabler. However, demand on the networks is growing throughout the globe, making cost reductions harder to effect.
      In today’s environment of austerity, operators are rethinking business models, searching out new solutions and revisiting old ones to deliver lower-cost networks. This session highlights some of the most outstanding examples of ingenuity and shows how operators around the world can employ similar measures.

    <t>Consumer Devices:  Riding the Next Wave of Smart Devices </t>
    <o>
      Smart consumer devices – from smartphones to tablets, eReaders, connected TVs and more – are changing from being premium items to suit mass-market customers. While this offers potentially significant new revenue streams from end users, it also adds to the much-discussed ‘data tsunami’.
      Moreover, as Internet, application, content and device companies scramble to take advantage of this brave new world, operators risk becoming marginalised unless they can develop business strategies and partnerships to gain a share of a fruitful new market.
      What will the smart device future look like and where do operators fit into it? What strategies and services offer the greatest opportunities? How can operators avoid simply being drowned in data? We examine how operators across the globe are leveraging their positions and resources to take their share of these new revenue streams.

    <t>Mobile Advertising: The Mobile Advertising Ecosystem - Making it Work</t>
    <o>
      As mobile increasingly becomes a recognised medium for brand advertising and marketing, albeit one that in most cases still only attracts tentative investment, the value chain is expanding. There are two underlying approaches emerging: one that sees mobile as a separate channel to be used either independently or to be fitted at the edges of a wider campaign; the other considers mobile to be just one part of the marketing mix but one that is nevertheless central to media planning from the start.
      This session will take a practical look at how the value chain is evolving for mobile advertising. It will examine what type of players are currently in the mobile advertising value chain, consider the return on investment of the model as it currently stands, and discuss what the marketplace should look like to sustain a fruitful mobile advertising channel.

    <t>Mobile Security Forum Session Sponsored by Norton by Symantec</t>
    <o>
      In the past few years, the number of Internet connected devices per household has risen from 1.5 to  4.5, each of them surfing the web, downloading apps and putting an increasing amount of our personal lives online.  So, what effect if any does today’s mobile device explosion have on the state of information security and consumers’ personal safety? Are the security considerations the same as we evolve from a world where people connect to the internet and to each other from the home to one where these connections happen anywhere and everywhere? And as an increasing amount of personal information becomes woven into our mobile lives, are we putting our finances or even our physical selves at risk when device loss or theft happens to 1 in 3 consumers?

      At this panel, security leader Norton and other industry experts will explore how mobile is redefining security. Privacy, multiple devices and mobile-specific threats are among the new challenges being brought to light in this complex new ecosystem. Here, we’ll discuss not only how cybercriminals are adapting to the new threat landscape but also how the emerging mobile market is driving demand for a whole new definition of the word ‘security’.

    <t>Mobile Money: NFC Services Gain Momentum</t>
    <o>
      NFC services are gaining momentum and the market potential is significant. Frost and Sullivan estimates that by 2015, there will be more than 860 million NFC-enabled handsets worldwide. Furthermore, Juniper Research forecasts that the payment value of NFC will reach $170 billion worldwide by 2015.
      Several of the world’s handset manufacturers, mobile network operators and payment providers have started to roll-out commercial NFC services in several markets, with the number set to grow over the coming 12 months. NFC is well-known in the area of mobile payments, but beyond this, it will facilitate mobile ticketing, mobile couponing, the exchange of information and content, control access to cars, homes, hotels and many more services.
      This session will provide an overview of what’s happening in the world of NFC. It will explore what recently rolled-out commercial NFC services look like, and what future services are expected to offer to consumers. It will also address what is required of the mobile ecosystem to facilitate the widespread adoption of these services.

    <t>Embedded Mobile: State of the Market</t>
    <o>
      While the consumer electronics segment is well-established in the utilisation of embedded mobile in, for example, e-readers and tablets, the automotive, healthcare and utilities sectors represent relatively untapped market opportunities for the mobile ecosystem. Safety, security and infotainment services in cars, and smart metering utility services are just some examples of embedded mobile solutions which are having a tangible effect on people’s lives.
      Mobile network operators are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the huge market opportunity; they provide the ubiquitous network connectivity, are developing the Embedded SIM and have the mobile infrastructure and customer support services in place. Mobile network operators can further strengthen the embedded mobile proposition by working closely with vertical sectors to bring these solutions to market.
      This session will provide an overview of the state of the embedded market and will explore which vertical sectors represent the greatest market opportunities. It will also address the challenges in bringing profitable embedded solutions to market and will ask whether mobile capacity is able to cope with the expected growth in demand for embedded mobile solutions.

    <t>Networks: Delivering Quality of Experience, Despite Capacity Constraints</t>
    <o>
      Consumers and enterprises often face low barriers to switching mobile network operators, and one of the key drivers of switching behaviour is a poor quality of experience with that provider. Network capacity is frequently discussed as a limiting factor on delivering a good quality of service, particularly relating to low-latency services such as content streaming. As a result, investing in new, higher speed networks and increasing capacity in busy areas has become an expensive priority.
      However, the relationship between Quality of Experience and network capacity is not straightforward and operators risk spending in vain. Meanwhile a variety of techniques, particularly when used holistically, can improve the customer experience and delay the need for expensive new cell sites.
      So how do operators monitor and deliver top-quality experiences without breaking the bank? Find some of the best thinkers on the issue in this session.

    <t>Mobile Advertising: Emerging Markets </t>
    <o>
      Mobile is the brave new frontier for brands seeking to capitalise on opportunities in the high growth markets. Why? Because mobile is becoming the communication channel of choice for these consumers. For instance, more than 60% of Indian mobile internet users never even use the internet via a PC, and this mobile-first behaviour is being repeated across the emerging markets. It is this phenomenon that makes mobile a key gateway to new consumers in the emerging economies.
      This session will look at the opportunities and challenges for all players in the mobile advertising ecosystem to build mobile into a successful channel for advertising in the high-growth markets. Players from across the value chain will examine the current mobile marketing state of play in these markets, will consider the consumer appetite for receiving marketing via their mobiles and will ask how the ecosystem should evolve to make the most of the nascent opportunity these markets offer.

      The Mobile World Live keynotes will once again feature the industry’s leading lights, sharing their visions for the future of mobile technology. These special stand-alone evening sessions are a break from the traditional format, and are the only Mobile World Congress conference sessions to be broadcast live over the internet and via Mobile World Live TV.
      Mobile World Live Keynote – Ericsson
      When Ericsson President and CEO Hans Vestberg predicted in 2010 that the number of internet connected devices would reach into the tens of billions, the claim was met with a degree of scepticism. As more and more vertical sectors begin to realise the incredible value embedded mobile technology can bring to their business and operating models however, the mobile industry appears ever closer to realising this incredible potential.
      How will these billions of connected devices impact our broadband networks, both fixed and wireless, and what investments in ICT infrastructure will be required to insure a smooth transition to the connected economy? How will all of these new devices affect our everyday lives and how will people be able to interact with the “internet of things”? What new platforms and services will these devices enable?
      In the final Mobile World Live keynote of the 2012 Mobile World Congress, Hans Vestberg will provide a tantalising glimpse into the future of the mobile industry.

    <t>Keynote 7: Driving the Mobile Technology Evolution</t>
    <o>
      As mobile operators across the globe upgrade their networks to LTE, the full promise of fast and ubiquitous mobile broadband is becoming a reality. However, as demand for data services continues to grow, it will become increasingly important for operators to deploy technologies which will not only make their networks more intelligent, but also make the best use of their spectrum allocations.

      Network architectures will need to evolve to reflect both the density of these new networks as well as the increased capacity they will carry. The drive to scale up the deployment of LTE-enabled devices will be just as important, while at the same time LTE Advanced looms large on the horizon with a whole new set of questions and challenges. Which factors will determine the technology investments operators make in the coming years? Can the industry do more to work collaboratively and build greater efficiencies into the R&amp;D and manufacturing process? How will regulation impact the growth of the mobile ecosystem?

      Join some of the industry’s technology pioneers as they discuss the future of the networks which underpin all that is mobile.

    <t>Embedded Mobile: The Market Opportunity in the Automotive and Utilities Sectors </t>
    <o>
      The automotive and utilities sectors, amongst others, represent strong market opportunities for mobile network operators and other service providers. Embedding telematics into vehicles which use mobile connectivity to deliver safety and security services, and infotainment services such as internet access, live traffic updates and weather reports are becoming increasingly commonplace. Meanwhile, mobile connectivity is enabling utilities suppliers to more effectively manage the supply and demand of consumers’ energy and water.
      The market opportunity for embedded mobile in the automotive and utilities sectors will be evaluated in this session. It will also explore the types of services that can be expected in the future and the role of the various players in the value chain in bringing these solutions to market, whilst addressing critical successful factors.

      Even in the near future, operators will need to deliver higher capacities, new services and higher Quality of Service to the customer, while improving efficiency and lowering cost internally. For most operators, this revolution must be achieved by an evolution in their radio, aggregation and core networks.
      Mobile operators have already started to deploy heterogeneous network structures combining different generations of wireless technologies, often embedded in an environment of macro-, micro- and even femto-cells. Furthermore, LTE-Advanced features, new centralised RAN and smart network architectures are currently being developed and evaluated.
      As a result, many of the elements needed to deliver a flexible, intelligent network already exist or will appear in the near future. The main challenge is to do it right - to bring the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that supports an operator’s financial, technical and business needs throughout the evolutionary process. This session highlights how industry leaders are working towards this and what steps should be taken.

    <t>Mobile Money: Emerging Markets - Where are the Opportunities for Mobile Money?</t>
    <o>
      Several emerging markets represent strong growth opportunities for mobile money due to the high numbers of unbanked and under-banked customers. Money transfers, bill payments, cash withdrawals and forms of micro financing, often through simple but secure SMS messaging, are just some examples of mobile money services which are proving valuable to consumers in emerging markets, where mobile phone usage is high but where access to traditional banking services is limited.
      This session will explore where opportunities exist for mobile money services in emerging markets. It will discuss the role of mobile network operators, financial institutions and payment providers and the challenges in bringing mobile money services to emerging markets.

      Technology developments and business pressures are destroying many old barriers – between networks and IT, voice and data, fixed and mobile, telecoms and internet. This change offers operators the chance to manage their networks and services in new ways, lowering costs and opening up fresh business opportunities.
      However, for operators to take full advantage of these opportunities requires some radical changes throughout their business, networks and IT systems. There are considerable challenges to overcome, not least the management of converged networks, of different wireless technology generations and of an increasingly complex multi-vendor environment.
      Based upon practical experience, this session focuses on how to evolve mobile network operations effectively. It offers delegates the chance to understand the path towards a new style of network operations, how to take advantage of its benefits and how to avoid the dangers on the way.

He&#xA;serves as chairman of the board's Finance Committee and as a member of the Sustainability&#xA;Committee. He also served as chief executive officer of the company from October 2001 to&#xA;September 2006, when he was named executive chairman.&#xA;As CEO, Mr. Ford improved quality, lowered costs and delivered exciting new products. During his&#xA;time in that position he took the company from a $5.5 billion loss in 2001 to three straight years of&#xA;profitability. Through the years, his vision for the company has remained unchanged.&#xA;“I want us to be a company that makes a difference in people's lives; one that delights its customers,&#xA;rewards its shareholders and makes the world a better place,” he says. “To do that we are focused on&#xA;delivering desirable products, a competitive cost structure and a sustainable business model.”&#xA;Mr. Ford joined Ford Motor Company in 1979 as a product planning analyst.

    <o>2operate adds intelligence to your OSS and reduces the number of incidents sent to 3rd line support by half. The key to efficient incident management is to enable 1st line support staff to diagnose and solve more incidents. With 2operate you can achieve this by adding a layer of intelligence on top of your existing OSS. Troubleshooting experience is built into knowledge bases, and advanced reasoning technology is used to diagnose network elements with degraded performance. This leads to satisfied customers and shields "back office" staff from unnecessary fire-fighting tasks. In summary: Improved NETWORK QUALITY, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, and OPEX REDUCTIONS.</o>

    <o>As demand for wireless bandwidth continues to soar, existing mobile networks are reaching their limits. Operators have responded by deploying 4G mobile technologies that deliver the data-optimized performance that emerging devices and applications require.  Transport networks are now under equal pressure and traditional microwave and T1/E1 backhaul networks can no longer scale economically.  As a result, operators are migrating to high capacity packet-based backhaul.  DragonWave’s point-to-point packet microwave networks deliver unprecedented capacity and spectral efficiency, meeting the increasingly stringent requirements of carrier-class operators.  DragonWave’s packet convergence platforms enable a gradual evolution from TDM to packet based networks.</o>

      Evolving Systems’ dynamic provisioning solution is a new way of providing service to any mobile or connected device with a SIM card.

      Marketing initiatives, expanding distribution, and new products can call for massive increases in SIM card supply. Dynamic provisioning allows operators to meet this challenge whilst avoiding the cost and inefficiency of traditional provisioning processes. By provisioning devices dynamically, resources, products and tariffs are not allocated to a device until it is first used. This creates a “golden moment” when customers can explore relevant services and personalize them.

      Founded in 1985, Evolving Systems’ software and services assure delivery success.

      KOTRA was established in 1962 to bolster the Korean economy through trade. It has since traveled alongside Korea on its journey of economic growth.

      In the 1960s and 70s, KOTRA developed overseas markets and in doing so served as a driving force in increasing Korea’s exports. In the 1980s, near the end of the Cold War, KOTRA led efforts to achieve economic diplomacy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. During the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, as a national investment promotion agency, KOTRA attracted foreign investment to Korea and helped steer the nation out of the economic downturn.

      Today, with 111 Korea Business Centers in 76 countries worldwide, KOTRA serves as a vessel through which foreign companies can conveniently cooperate with Korean companies.
