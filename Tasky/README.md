Tasky
=====

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items.

Tasky supports three platforms - iOS, Android and Windows Phone - each with a native UI written in C#. It uses a local SQLite database to store the tasks.

Common code lives in a [Shared Project](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/), which is referenced by each application project. This project type requires Xamarin 3 (Xamarin Studio 5.x) or Visual Studio 2013 Update 2.

Xamarin.Forms Version
---------------------
The equivalent app written with [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) is called [Todo](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Todo).
