Tasky
=====

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items.

Tasky supports three platforms: iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

Common code lives in a [Shared Project](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/), which is referenced by each application project. This project type requires Xamarin 3 (Xamarin Studio 5.x) or Visual Studio 2013 Update 2.
