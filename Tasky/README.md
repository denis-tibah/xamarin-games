Tasky
=====

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items. It illustrates proper application architecture
layering and uses a common code base for the Business Layer (BL), Data Access
Layer (DAL), and Data Layer (DL) layers. It then separates out the User
Interface (UI) and Application Layer (AL) into the appropriate device-applications.
