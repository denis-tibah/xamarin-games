# MonoGame tvOS Project

This solution contains an empty MonoGame tvOS project. It contains a pre-compiled .dll (not from Nuget) since MonoGame does not currently distribute a tvOS .dll.

This project contains an empty Game class with a single call to GraphicsDevice.Clear, setting the background color to Color.CornflowerBlue.

This demo includes MonoGame.Framework.dll which was compiled using MonoGame 3.5 source.
