# MonoGame WalkingGame Project for iOS and Android

This is a small demo game using MonoGame for iOS and Android, using a shared code project.  It is the result of working through the the entire [Introduction to Monogame walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/graphics-games/monogame/introduction/).

The demo can be played by touching the screen to move the character around the screen.

It is built against MonoGame 3.3.
