  The project requires a 'PrivateStrings.xml' file exist with the following elements 
  populated with data that you do not wish to commit to github.
  
  To obtain a Google Maps API key, follow these instructions:
  http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/Obtaining_a_Google_Maps_API_Key
  
  Once you have obtained the values, use this file as a template to create
  'PrivateStrings.xml' with the correct data. Remember not to commit your
  private values to a publicly-shared repository.
  
  
  **DON'T FORGET** you will need a key for the development certificate (see doc above)
  and another one for your RELEASE certificate
  http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html
  
  
   **ALSO DON'T FORGET** to change the names around before your release build!
   <string name="GoogleMapAPIKey">Your Key Here</string>
   <string name="GoogleMapAPIKeyRELEASE">Your Key Here</string>
