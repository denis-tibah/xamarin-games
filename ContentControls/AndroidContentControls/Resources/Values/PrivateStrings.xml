  <!--
  To obtain a Google Maps API key, follow these instructions:
  http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/Obtaining_a_Google_Maps_API_Key
  
  Once you have obtained the values, use this file as a template to create
  'PrivateStrings.xml' with the correct data. Remember not to commit your
  private values to a publicly-shared repository.
  
  
  **DON'T FORGET** you will need a key for the development certificate (see doc above)
  and another one for your RELEASE certificate
  http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html
  
  You should RENAME the keys (remove RELEASE from the key name).
