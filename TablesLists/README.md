Tables and Lists
================

iOS
---
This sample illustrates the various table and cell styles available out of
the box, as well as illustrates how to create custom cells both in code,
and using Xib files.

Android
-------

This sample illustrates Android's built-in ListView styles and some customizations that are possible.

One of the Activities - Screens/CustomTables/CustomFastScroll - requires API level 11. 
You can set the API level in the Project Properties. You must also uncomment the "CustomFastScroll" style
in Resources/Values/Styles.xml (since that will not build on earlier versions).
